# PointsCollection
Task:
- Create class Point (X,Y) 
- Point can be placed in each quadrant in the Cartesian coordinate system.
- Points p1 and p2 equals if |p1.X|=|p2.X| && |p1.Y|=|p2.Y| && |p1.Z|=|p2.Z|, where Z - quadrant.
- Points can be compared with "==" Ð¸ "!=" operators.
- Allow to use arithmetic operations between points (+, - , *) like in vectors.
- Create Points Collection.
- Create indexer like collection[Xi,Yj] (access by coordinates).
- Allow Add/Delete methods in collection (if collection already have the point you can't add another one).
- Collection can be sorted using method Sort() by distance from the center (0,0)
- Create method for show currrnt state of point/collection
